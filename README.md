# Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Packages:
    * scipy package
    * numpy package
    * matplotlib package
    * scikit-commpy package

All packages can be installed using `pip3 install <packagename>`

# Running
All python files are executable and will produce matplotlib plot(s). Running
`main.py` will execute all modules and display the figures. Note that the
figures do not contain titles because these were added in the document as figure
captions.

`python3 <filename>.py`

Running plot_to_latex.py will save all output plots to `.pgf` files for easy
importing into a latex document.
